Explanations for all .csv files used to create the final_inhibitors_dataframe.csv and final_inhib_kin_dataframe.csv

* uniprot_acc_nums.csv
- A list of UniProt accession numbers extracted from the generation of the human_kinase_dataframe.csv

* chembl_inhibitors.csv
- A dataframe that contains the cleaned data that was extracted from chEMBL
- This dataframe doesn't contain any information from BindingDB

* inhibitors_dataframe.csv
- Full inhibitors dataframe with information from both BindingDB and chEMBL
- This dataframe was created before adding extra inhibitors 

* inhib_kin_dataframe.csv
- Full inhibitors-kinase relationships  dataframe with information from both BindingDB and chEMBL
- This dataframe was created before adding extra inhibitors

* extra_chembls.txt
- A list of chEMBL IDs that were present in http://www.icoa.fr/pkidb/ but not in the inhibitor_dataframe.csv
- This list was manually curated by searching chEMBL IDs from http://www.icoa.fr/pkidb/ in the inhibitors_dataframe.csv

* extra_inhibs.csv
- The full cleaned  dataframe containing information from both chEMBL and BindingDB on the extra kinases from extra_chembls.txt
- This was then merged with inhibitors_dataframe.csv to form the final dataframe
